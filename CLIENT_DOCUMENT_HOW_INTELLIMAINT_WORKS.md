# IntelliMaint: How Our Platform Works
## A Complete Guide for Teams and Managers

---

## Executive Summary

**IntelliMaint** is an intelligent assistant that helps maintenance teams, field technicians, and operations staff get instant answers from their equipment manuals and documentation. Instead of searching through pages of guides, you can now ask questions by typing, speaking, or showing a photo—and get step-by-step answers in seconds.

Think of it as having an expert mechanic available 24/7, right on your phone or computer, whether you're in the field or at your desk.

## The Problem: Why Do Teams Need This?

Every day, maintenance teams face the same challenges:

- **Searching takes too long** – A technician spends 20–30 minutes digging through manuals to find one answer
- **Equipment downtime costs money** – Every minute a machine is broken, your operation loses productivity and revenue
- **Knowledge is scattered** – Manuals are in different places; team members don't know where to find information
- **New technicians need training** – Onboarding takes weeks because they don't know the equipment guides
- **Mistakes happen** – Without quick access to official instructions, repairs are done incorrectly, causing repeat breakdowns
- **Teams can't collaborate** – When one technician finds a solution, others don't know about it
- **Field work is inefficient** – Stopping to search manuals means taking off gloves, finding your phone, typing, reading—all while holding up work

**The result?** Longer downtime, higher costs, frustrated teams, and lost productivity.

## The Solution: Meet IntelliMaint

IntelliMaint turns your equipment manuals and documentation into an **intelligent, always-available assistant** that your team can talk to.

### Here's how it works:

1. **Upload your documents** – Add PDFs of equipment manuals, maintenance guides, or training materials (or use our built-in library of 6,000+ manuals)
2. **Ask your question** – Type, speak, or upload a photo
3. **Get an instant answer** – AI finds the exact information from your documents and gives you step-by-step guidance
4. **Get back to work** – Follow the instructions, complete the repair, and move on—no more searching

**The difference?** A problem that used to take 30 minutes to solve now takes 2 minutes.

## Frequently Asked Questions

**Q: What documents should I upload?**
A: Any equipment manuals, maintenance guides, troubleshooting procedures, safety documentation, or training materials relevant to your business. PDFs work best.

**Q: How long does it take to upload and index a document?**
A: Upload is instant (1–2 seconds). Indexing takes 30 seconds to 2 minutes depending on file size. Once indexed, it's searchable forever.

**Q: Can I upload classified or sensitive documents?**
A: Yes. Classified documents stay completely private within your team account. Only people you've invited have access.

**Q: What if my team is in the field with no internet?**
A: You can pre-download certain documents for offline access. Chat requires internet, but previously loaded documents work offline.

A: Yes. IntelliMaint works on phones, tablets, and computers. Voice mode is optimized for mobile field work.

**Q: How accurate are the answers?**
A: The accuracy depends on how complete and clear your documents are. If your manual says "Replace bolt with a 7mm wrench," the AI will tell your technician to use a 7mm wrench.

**Q: What happens if the AI doesn't know the answer?**
A: The system will tell you honestly: "I couldn't find information about that in your documents." You can then upload the missing manual or ask a follow-up question.

**Q: Can I export chat histories for compliance?**
A: Yes. Export conversations as text or PDF for documentation, audits, or team review.

**Q: Who gets access to the admin dashboard?**
A: You choose. Assign managers/supervisors to the Admin role; they can then see team activity, uploads, and analytics.
